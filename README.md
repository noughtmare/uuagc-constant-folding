# uuagc-constant-folding
Example of a constant folding transformation implemented with uuagc.

I've written this to show an alternative way of implementing the traversal from https://www.michaelpj.com/blog/2020/08/02/lenses-for-tree-traversals.html, which is discussed at [this reddit thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/i2js6q/lenses_for_tree_traversals/).

This repository is meant for people who want to try out attribute grammars for themselves.

## How to run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/noughtmare/uuagc-constant-folding.git
$ cd uuagc-constant-folding
$ cabal run
```
